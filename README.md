# Climate Change Solutions - Carbon Capturing and Sequestration
<b> Assumptions </b>

Current predictions are assuming that the percentage of global emissions by sector remain constant for the entire duration. Predictive models need further work to validate p, d, and q values. Approximation for global emissions from indusry and energy producing sectors derived from percent given by Global-GHG-Emissions CSV.

- Auto correlation requires reduction in all models.
