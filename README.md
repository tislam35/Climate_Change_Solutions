# Climate Change Solutions - Carbon Capturing and Sequestration
<b> Assumptions </b>

- Percentage of global emissions by sector remains roughly the same over the forecasted period
- No unexpected events occur over the forecasted period to alter emissions pattern
- No unexpected events occur over the forecasted period to alter carbon storage growth rate
- Only the industry and energy producing sectors produce carbon emissions from stationary facilities
- The percentage of global carbon emissions from the industry and energy producing sectors is given by their global GHG emissions and percent composition of GHG
- There is an unlimited supply of land to house the growing number of CCS facilities
- There is an unlimited supply of money to fund the growth of CCS facilities
- Application of CCS includes both retrofitting existing facilities and building new facilities.

<b> Limitations of forecast </b>

- Existing CCS data is sparse before the 21st century
- The 2015 Paris Agreement has dramatically increased the number of soon to be operational CCS facilities in recent years
- There are a number of years that do not have any growth in CCS storage capacity
- Values for p, d, and q are limited
- Data is not seasonal or stationary

<b> Limitations of solution </b>

- Cost of CCS per tonne of carbon dioxide processed is general more expensive than other means of reducing carbon emissions
- Land use for storing captured carbon is limited
- Cost of CCS application depends on the purity and concentration of carbon dioxide at the source.
